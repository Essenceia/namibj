# Expresso ASIC 

Open source Ethernet focused ASIC featuring a 
100Mbps capable cut-trough, unmanaged, Ethernet switch. 
This chip is targetting was designed for the second run of [wafer.space](https://wafer.space/) 
targetting the open source Global Foundaries 180 nm process (`gf180mcu`).

Features: 
- Ethernet switch:
  - 3x Full duplex Ethernet ports, 100BASE-TX (classic RJ42 cat-3 connection) 
  - Unmanaged switch 
  - Cut-though forwarding
- Heat death of the Universe counter:
  - Broadcasts an Ethernet Frame over the local network ever 1s
  - 100Mbps Ethernet compatible, 100BASE-TX
  - Our solar system will be gone before it overflows 


## Coffee-shop family 

This full chip ties together in a single package multiple projects that are all part of larger family of open-source Ethernet connected IP: 
- [`coffeepot` first generation switch.](https://github.com/Essenceia/ethernet_switch_asic) - included 
- [`teapot` Ethernet wrapper for building network connected accelerators.](https://github.com/Essenceia/Teapot)
- [`coldbrew` Ethernet connected beacon for broadcasting an ethernet frame with an uptime count until the heat death of the universe.](https://github.com/Essenceia/Until_Heat_Death_Do_Us_Part) - included

This IP has been re-addapted to make the best use of a full chip tapeout, checkout the `ws_run2` branch or the submodules to see the version of the IP being used.
